# Smart Email Guardian – Deployment & Verification Guide

## 🎯 Objective
This document provides instructions for deploying and verifying your AI-powered spam/phishing detection toolkit. The goal is to ensure your application is accessible, functional, and secure—without requiring paid services.

## ✅ What You Must Submit 
- A public GitHub repository with the full project
- A working CLI tool (`email_guard.py`) that accepts input and returns results
- A deployed web or mobile interface
- A hosted backend API with a /scan endpoint
- A demo video if mobile app cannot be hosted
- A `README.md` and `reflection.md` with documentation and what you learned

## 🌐 Free Hosting Platforms
You can use these platforms to deploy your application:
- **Frontend**: [Vercel](https://vercel.com) – great for React, Flask UI, or Streamlit
- **Backend**: [Render](https://render.com), [Railway](https://railway.app), or [Replit](https://replit.com)
- **Mobile**: Use [Expo](https://expo.dev/) and share the live preview or a video recording

## 🔍 What We’ll Check (Review Checklist) 
- A live frontend app (via Vercel or demo video)
- A working backend with `/scan` endpoint
- Secure communication (HTTPS hosting or localhost tunnel)
- Clear `README.md` for setup and testing
- Proper folder structure and clean code
- Documented security practices in `security_not

## 🚀 Hosting Your Project (Frontend Example)
To deploy a frontend on Vercel: 
1. Push your frontend code to GitHub 
2. Go to https://vercel.com and sign in 
3. Import your GitHub project 
4. Vercel will auto-deploy and give you a public link 
5. Share this link in your `README.md`

## 🚀 Hosting Your Backend (Example Using Render)
1. Push your backend code (Flask/FastAPI) to GitHub 
2. Go to https://render.com and sign in 
3. Create a new web service → link your GitHub repo 
4. Set start command (e.g., `python app.py`) and expose port 10000 or 5000 
5. Render will give you a public URL 
6. Add this to your frontend and documentation
